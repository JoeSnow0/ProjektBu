  text: "It took Rachel, she got a little bit too close and now she's a part of *it*.
    I'm trying to stay focused on the work but its getting harder and harder to do,
    will we all end up like her? The security team say they have the entity under
    control down in containment but I haven't dared to go. I can't see her like...that.
    \n\nIm sorry Rachel, I am so so sorry."

  text: "Few of us would've believed it possible if it hadn't been so readily presented
    to us, clearing all doubt from our minds in but an instant. The Deep Sea #5 has
    served us well. We've been able to take a closer look at the impact location
    aswell as perform our tests in peace and quiet, away from prying eyes. Although
    I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the bouts of claustrophobia that this place
    seems to instill in each and everyone of us. We're managing it through medication
    and so far everyone seems to be doing alright. \n\n//Science Officer Guy Derring"
